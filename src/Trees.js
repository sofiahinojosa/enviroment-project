            <p>Trees are the <strong>longest living species on earth</strong>, they give us a link between the past, 
                present and future. Itâ€™s critical that woodlands, rainforests and trees in urban 
                settings, such as parks, are preserved and sustainably managed across the world. 
                <strong>Why do we need trees anyway?</strong></p>

                <li>Trees act as a physical filter</li>
                <li>Trees and shrubs are known to have medicinal properties</li>
                <li>They absorb carbon dioxide as they grow</li>
                <li>Reduce wind speeds and cool the air as they lose moisture and reflect heat</li>
                <li>Help prevent flooding and soil erosion</li>
                <li>Stress levels go down withing minutes of being surrouded by trees</li>

            <p>People have proposed many solutions to this environmental issue called <strong>deforestation</strong>, 
            including either shipping everyone to the Moon or...to just <strong>stop cutting trees!</strong> Without trees, 
            humans would not be able survive because the <strong>air would be unsuitable for breathing.</strong> If anything, people would 
            have to develop gas masks that filter the little oxygen that would be left in the air. If there aren't trees, 
            <strong>there won't be any products you can get from them.</strong> We use and waste paper everyday without realizing we're helping 
            to kill <strong>four billion trees cut down every year.</strong> Food harvested from trees like fruits, nuts, 
            berries (and maple syrup) would be nonexistent as well. Let's do something about it now!</p>
