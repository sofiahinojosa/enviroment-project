            <p>Cutting trees has led to this issue called <strong>deforestation.</strong> People
                have proposed solutions such as sending everyone to the 
                moon, but there only real solution is to stop cutting trees! We 
                need trees to have <strong>healthy air to breathe.</strong> Lets do something about it now :)</p>
