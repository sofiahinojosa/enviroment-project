            <p>Trees are the <strong>longest living species on earth.</strong> Itâ€™s important that all woodlands, 
            rainforests and trees found in urban places (for example parks) are preserved and sustainably managed across the world.</p>

                <li>Trees act as a physical filter</li>
                <li>Trees and shrubs have medicinal properties</li>
                <li>They absorb carbon dioxide as they grow</li>
                <li>Reduce wind speeds and cool the air</li>
                <li>Help prevent flooding and soil erosion</li>
                <li>Stress levels go down withing minutes of being surrouded by trees</li>

            <p>People have many solutions to this issue, <strong>deforestation.</strong> Some include
             shipping everyone to the Moon or crazy ideas like that. The real solution is 
             to just <strong>stop cutting trees!</strong> If we didn't have trees, 
            we would not be able survive because the <strong>air would be unhealthy for breathing.</strong> We would 
            have to invent gas masks that filter the little oxygen that we have left. Without 
            trees, there also <strong>won't be any products you can get from them.</strong> Let's do something about this now!</p>
